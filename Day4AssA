git clone is use to get a local copy of an existing repository to work on. It's usually only used once for a given repository, unless you want to have multiple working copies of it around. (Or want to get a clean copy after messing up your local one...)

git pull (or git fetch + git merge) is use to update that local copy with new commits from the remote repository. If you are collaborating with others, it is a command that you will run frequently.
